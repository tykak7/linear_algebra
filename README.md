  1. **Gram–Schmidt_orthonormal.ipynb**

Consider the Hilbert space of functions [-1, 1]^2 → R integrable with a scalar quadratic
⟨f|g⟩ = int(-1,1) int(-1,1) f(x,y) g(x, y) dxdy.
The subspace P is determined by the non-orthogonal basis 1, x^2, y^2, x^2 * y^2
Orthonormalize this basis with the Gram-Schmidt algorithm in the given order of vectors.

Consider the plane R^2 the line given by the equation
ax + by = 0

(a) Write the matrix M of the mirror around this line.
(b) Calculate the determinant of the matrix M.
(c) Calculate the matrix M^2.

  4. **signature_of_the_quadratic_form.ipynb**

Determine the signature of the quadratic form of the function
f(x,y,z) = 2(x - y)^2 + (y - z)^2 - 2x*z

  6. **extremum.ipynb**

Functions f has an extremum at (x, y) = (2, 3).
(a) Verify this statement.
(b) Determine the type of this extremum.
